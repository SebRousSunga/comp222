     1.  minesweeper

         * Adjacency
            - Every allocated cell has 8 neighbors
            - A lot of cells with an adjacent count of 0
            - FIgure out adjacency between 0 to 8
            - Do we need an adjacency list?

         * To-Do List

             1. Create mines,randomly distrubte to various cells around the board
                 - Go to cell, mined atribute, set to 1, indicated as a mined cell

             1. Create an adjacency count for all cells not mined
                 - Set adjcount to all adjacenct cells mined
                 - Does it vary depending on adjacent count?
